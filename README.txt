Notes:

This project should be run with the backend started first. The backend is a simple Spring Boot server that can be run standalone, without any need for additional configurations.

We strongly recommend you run this App on a Pixel 3a with API level 32 as it works the best with our UI design.

The Java SDK version here doesn't really matter. 16 and 17 should both work. 11 should also be fine.
